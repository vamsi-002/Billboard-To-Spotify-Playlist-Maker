### Obtain Spotify API Credentials

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account:**
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
   - Log in with your Spotify account or create a new one if you donâ€™t have one.

2. **Create a New Application:**

   - Here, you will find your Client ID and Client Secret.

4. **Set Up Redirect URI:**
   - Go to the "Edit Settings" of your application.
   - Add `http://example.com` as a Redirect URI. This is required for the OAuth process.

### Add Credentials to `.env` File

1. **Create a `.env` file** in your project directory (if it doesn't already exist).

   ```plaintext
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
